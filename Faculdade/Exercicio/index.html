    <p>
        Sheets of empty canvas
        Untouched sheets of clay
        Were laid spread out before me
        As her body once did
    </p>

<p>
    All five horizons
    Revolved around her soul
    As the earth to the sun
    Now the air I tasted and breathed
    Has taken a turn
</p>

<p>
    Oh, and all I taught her was everything
    Oh, I know she gave me all that she wore
</p>

<p>
    And now my bitter hands
    Chafe beneath the clouds
    Of what was everything
    Oh, the pictures have
    All been washed in black
    Tattooed everything
</p>

<p>
    I take a walk outside
    I'm surrounded by some kids at play
    I can feel their laughter
    So, why do I sear?
    
    Oh, and twisted thoughts that spin round my head
    I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning
    How quick the sun can drop away?
</p>

<p>
    And now my bitter hands
    Cradle broken glass
    Of what was everything
    All the pictures have
    All been washed in black
    Tattooed everything
    All the love gone bad
    Turned my world to black
    Tattooed all I see
    All that I am
    All that I'll be, yeah
</p>

<p>
    I know someday you'll have a beautiful life
    I know you'll be a star
    In somebody else's sky, but why? Why? Why
    Can't it be, oh, can't it be mine?
</p>
